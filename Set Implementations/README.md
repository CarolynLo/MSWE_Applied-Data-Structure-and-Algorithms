# Description:

## Data set
- Linked list
- Binary tree
- Hash table
## Methods:
- boolean add(String word)
- boolean contains(String word)
- int size()

## Input files:
- [pride-and-prejudice.txt](pride-and-prejudice.txt): Insert all the words into three different data set
- [words-shuffled.txt](words-shuffled.txt): Search each of these words in each data set

## [Report](Exercise1.pdf)
- Conduct experiments ten times to get the performance of each data set.
- Measure insertion time for each word (in nanoseconds)
- Measure search time for each word (in nanoseconds)
- Do complexity analysis of my code and the runtime performance analysis
